\section{Goals}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Goals for the 10 Weeks of Summer Research}
\begin{itemize}
\item You will learn what (applied mathematics) research is by engaging in it.
\item You will get to the frontier of research.
\item You will contribute new ideas that push our understanding forward.
\item You will distill those ideas into a correct and coherent form.
\item You will connect your ideas to those of others.
\item You will become proficient with various tools to aid your research endeavor, such 
as \LaTeX, Beamer, MATLAB, Julia, R, and Git.
\item You will communicate your work clearly to others, both verbally and in written form.
\item You will archive your work in the form of an article or piece of software so that others may benefit from it.
\item You will become better prepared for graduate study or your future career.
\end{itemize}

while learning the craft of applied and computational mathematics and learning to accomplish a lot as a team & while learning to be more independent, but maybe not ending up with much.

\frametitle{Announcements, Resources, and Discussions}

We will use  \beamerbutton{\href{https://piazza.com/iit/summer2017/reu}{Piazza}} for 
announcements and discussion, as well as for posting links to important resources.

We will also us the GAIL and SummerResearch2017 Git repositories.  See the Resources 
page on Piazza for links.
